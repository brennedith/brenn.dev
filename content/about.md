Hey there! I'm Brennedith Gracia, a software developer with a knack for making mistakes and a love for sharing what I've learned along the way. I'm from Honduras and currently call Mexico City my home.

But don't let my mistakes fool you - I'm also a professional with a keen eye for detail and a passion for creating top-notch software. Just don't be surprised if you come across some incomplete or downright "horror story" worthy content on my site.

After all, I'm just a regular guy sharing my personal notes with the world. Who knows, maybe you'll find something useful on my site!

Best,

Brenn
